        <p id="capybara-paragraph">Why is the Capybara a trending figure?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Capybara's have portrayed tame behaviour around all forms of animals and humans.</li>
            <li>Capybaras are consired cute by many.</li>
            <li>Capybaras have a relaxed and tranquil personality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Like many I find this animal to be quite fascinating to look at. The capybara has spread 
            throughout the internet in the forms of memes and video compilations. Over the past year,
            people have become aware of this animal. Being one of many I want to showcase this animal
            as many may not be aware of its existence. The capybara is one the world's most friendliest 
            creature to exist.
